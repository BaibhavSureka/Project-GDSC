This HTML code creates a webpage for a hotel search application.

HTML Structure
The HTML code starts with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration which specifies that the document is an HTML5 document. Then, the <html> element is used to define the document's root.

The <head> section contains metadata about the document such as character set, viewport settings, and the title of the webpage. It also links the Bootstrap stylesheet and JavaScript files which are used for styling and interactivity. Additionally, custom CSS styles are included in the <style> section.

The <body> element defines the visible portion of the HTML document. It contains the navigation bar and the search results section.

Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is created using the Bootstrap framework. It consists of a navbar with a toggler button that collapses the menu on smaller screens. The navbar contains a logo, a search form, and links to the pricing, listing, and contact pages.

Search Results Section
The search results section contains a filter and a list of hotel cards. The filter allows the user to sort the hotels alphabetically or reverse alphabetically. The list of hotels is created using Bootstrap cards. Each card displays a hotel image, name, location, and a "Book Now" button.
